      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://p5js.org/&#34;&gt;p5js&lt;/a&gt; that takes all the hardwork out of rendering on canvas and allows you to focus on the functional part of the application. As an experiment, I decided to investigate attractor functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of binary character string encoding. In this part I discuss in detail how the encoding process was optimised even further to reduce the shape information to just a few bytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges while doing my js1k challenge was rendering shapes. In this part of the series I will discuss in detail the various possibilities of drawing shapes and why I chose to go with binary char encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I needed another copy of the git repository I was working on but it seemed like an awful lot of work cloning it another folder and then switching back and forth and fetching/pushing to keep it all up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
